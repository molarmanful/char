    <pre class="des"><b>char</b> is a 2D, text-rendered game. You are pitted against one powerful enemy, and your goal is to survive as long as possible.

<u><b>THE MAP</b></u>
The map wraps around itself, meaning that going off the left edge (for example) will have you end up at the right edge if it is unobstructed by a wall.

<u><b>YOU</b></u>
You are green. Your score is determined by the amount of seconds you survive. You also have a power level. If your power is ≤0, then you will die and the game will end. You gain 1 power unit every moment up to a maximum power of 2000.
You can activate a forcefield that will clear any surrounding walls and force the enemy to respawn if the enemy walks into a field unit. Every activation of the forcefield costs you 50 power units, but every enemy respawn gives you 100 power units.

<u><b>THE ENEMY</b></u>
The enemy can walk through walls and has the ability to teleport. Each time the enemy teleports, it will change the map layout while doing so. 
In addition, it can activate a forcefield of its own that will reduce your power by 100 if you walk into its field unit. A direct encounter with the enemy (meaning that the enemy walks onto the same block as you) reduces your power by 500.

<u><b>CONTROLS</b></u>
 - w       : up
 - a       : left
 - s       : down
 - d       : right
 - [SPACE] : activate forcefield
