    <pre class="des"><b>char</b> is a 2D, text-rendered game. You are pitted against one powerful enemy, and your goal is to survive as long as possible.

<u><b>THE MAP</b></u>
The map wraps around itself, meaning that going off the left edge (for example) will have you end up at the right edge if it is unobstructed by a wall. You spawn at the right-top corner, while the enemy spawns in the center.

<u style='color:limegreen'><b>YOU</b></u>
Your score is determined by the amount of seconds you survive, and your survival is dependent on your power level (which starts/maxes out at 1000). If your power is ≤0, then you will die and the game will end. You lose power every .1 seconds.
You can activate a forcefield that will clear any surrounding walls and kill the enemy if the enemy walks into one of your field units. Every activation of the forcefield halves your power, but every enemy kill gives you 200 power units.

<u style='color:red'><b>THE ENEMY</b></u>
The enemy can break through walls and has the ability to teleport. Each time the enemy teleports, it will change the map layout while doing so. 
In addition, it can activate a forcefield of its own that will reduce your power by 100 if you walk into one of its field units. A direct encounter with the enemy (meaning that the enemy walks onto the same block as you) reduces your power by 500.
The enemy respawns in random places after it dies.

<u><b>CONTROLS</b></u>
 - w       : up
 - a       : left
 - s       : down
 - d       : right
 - [SPACE] : activate forcefield
